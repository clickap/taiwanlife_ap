PoodLL Filter
========================================
Thanks for downloading PoodLL.

Installation instructions and a video can be found at http://www.poodll.com .

If you are installing this mod separately from the full PoodLL kaboodle,
there should be only one folder "poodll" expanded after you unzip the zip file.
Place this folder into your moodle installation under the [site_root]/filter folder.

Then login to your site as an administrator and go to your Moodle site's "notifications" page. 
Moodle should then guide you through the installation or upgrade of the PoodLL filter. 
You can probably accept the defaults, scroll to the bottom of the page and press save.

You will then have to enable the filter. Go to:
"Site Administration->Plugins->Filters->Manage Filters"
And set the PoodLL Filter to "On."

If the Moodle "Multimedia Plugins" filter is also on, make sure that the PoodLL filter is higher in the list.

Moodle caching can affect audio/video playback reliability. To turn off text filter caching:  
Go to: Site Administration -> Plugins -> Filters ->Common Filter Settings
There set "Text Cache Lifetime" to "no"

All of the PoodLL mods require the PoodLL filter to be installed. 

Good luck.
